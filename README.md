# Databases - CoffeeToGo Project

This repository contains the SQL code and solutions for a series of database-related labs, designed to manage a coffee shop network called "CoffeeToGo". The database includes tables for managing coffee shops, employees, suppliers, customers, and product orders.

## Lab Overview

1. **Lab 1: Database Design**
   - Designed and implemented a database for managing coffee shops. Created tables for managing coffee shops, employees, suppliers, customers, and products. The database design includes primary and foreign keys, constraints, and normalization.

2. **Lab 2: Queries**
   - Created SQL queries to extract information from the database. Queries covered filtering, sorting, and retrieving data across various tables. Focused on real-world business operations, such as getting customer details and tracking supplier deliveries.

3. **Lab 3: Database Modification** 
   - Developed SQL scripts for modifying the structure of an existing database, including adding new columns, constraints, and tables, as well as scripts to reverse these changes. Implemented a versioning system to track database changes and allow rollback to previous versions.

4. **Lab 4: Database Testing**
   - Implemented stored procedures to test and evaluate database performance. Tests included evaluating insertion, deletion, and query execution times, especially for operations involving multiple tables and views.

5. **Lab 5: CRUD Operations**
   - Created SQL scripts and stored procedures to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database tables, ensuring proper data management and consistency across the system .
